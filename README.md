# Riddleapp

This is a very simple application that shows the answer to a riddle on the
click of a button

The purpose of this application was to demonstrate how html css and javascript
come together to make a web application work

It was made as a demonstration app for a Microsoft Tech Club session at
[BITS Pilani Dubai Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/dubai/index.aspx)
